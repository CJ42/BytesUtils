Solidity library to manipulate bits in integers and bytes, including getting subsets and toggling.

This library was based and inspired [*Catonmat.net: Low Level Bit Hacks*](https://catonmat.net/low-level-bit-hacks#:~:text=Bit%20hacks%20are%20ingenious%20little,two%20carefully%20chosen%20bitwise%20operations).
