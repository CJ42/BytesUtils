# BytesUtils
(Work in Progress) - Solidity library to manipulate bytes, including getting subsets and toggling.

This library is based on the article [catonmat.net: _Low Level Bit Hacks_](https://catonmat.net/low-level-bit-hacks#:~:text=Bit%20hacks%20are%20ingenious%20little,two%20carefully%20chosen%20bitwise%20operations), where every example aims to be implemented in Solidity.
